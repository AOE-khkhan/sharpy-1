SHARPy Documentation
====================

Welcome to SHARPy (Simulation of High Aspect Ratio Planes in Python)!

.. warning:: SHARPy is currently under development

SHARPy is an aeroelastic analysis package currently under development at the Department of Aeronautics,
Imperial College London. It can be used for the structural, aerodynamic, aeroelastic and flight dynamics
analysis of flexible aircraft, flying wings and wind turbines.

This site contains the available documentation of the software. The documentation project is still work in process and,
at the time of writing, only includes documentation for the Python modules of SHARPy, which encompass the aeroelastic
solvers and interfaces to the structural and aerodynamic modules.
The UVLM and structural modules are written in C++ and Fortran, respectively, and do not have
detailed documentation yet.

The objective of this documentation package is to show the user how to run cases by defining the geometry, flow
conditions and desired solution process.
